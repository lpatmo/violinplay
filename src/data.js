There are several ways to solve this problem. I tried to make this song sound like a person deliberating how to solve it the "easy" way in JavaScript first -- using .split() and .reverse() and .join() -- before attempting to solve it using a "for" loop and recursion, which are slightly more complicated ways. At the end of the song, the person finally reaches a lightbulb moment.',
